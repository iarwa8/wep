                <h3>what is ethical hacking?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Ethical hacking involves an authorized attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, application, or data. Carrying out an ethical hack involves duplicating strategies and actions of malicious attackers. This practice helps
                    to identify security vulnerabilities which can then be resolved before a malicious attacker has the opportunity to exploit them. Also known as “white hats,” ethical hackers are security experts that perform these assessments. The proactive
                    work they do helps to improve an organization’s security posture. With prior approval from the organization or owner of the IT asset, the mission of ethical hacking is opposite from malicious hacking.</p>

                <h3>What are some limitations of ethical hacking?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <ul style="list-style: disc;">
                        <li>Limited scope. Ethical cannot progress beyond a defined scope to make an attack successful. However, it’s not unreasonable to discuss out of scope attack potential with the organization.</li>
                        <li>Resource constraints. Malicious hackers don’t have time constraints that ethical hackers often face. Computing power and budget are additional constraints of ethical hackers.</li>
                        <li>Restricted methods. Some organizations ask experts to avoid test cases that lead the servers to crash (e.g., Denial of Service (DoS) attacks). </li>
